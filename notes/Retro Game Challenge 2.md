# Retro Game Challenge 2

It seems there is a "Power On! Voice" as well as
T-Shirt Designs available in the settings. Potential
achievements for these?

It seems possible to give up on challenges. What does that mean? Does it change the ending of the game or have some other effect?

There is a store called JoycoLand that can be visited.

We need something with Daily Challenges.p

Light Wands: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ds/953049-game-center-cx-arino-no-chousenjou-2/faqs/75654

There are 32 stages.
It's good to get shining crystals in order.
Shining crystals cause jewels to appear.
Every 100 coins causes a 1up tomato to appear.
Bells only appear on odd floors.
Chests only appear on even floors.
There are 22 Wiz-Man ranks.
Light Wand: on floor 1, beat two enemies, then beat two more, then beat three more enemies.
"Can you find the wands on all levels!?"
For unlimited continues, hold left and press Start on game over
What is the coffee break demo? It plays on the results screen
Floors can be skipped: "Right after you start you will see the first flashing crystal and another large crystal that sometimes flashes! If you get that one first and go on to get 4 cystals, you can skip the next floor."
On Floor 16, touching the top or bottom walls will reveal the Light Wand.
Enemies start dropping keys on Floor 2 and every 4th floor after that.
Enemies with a Treasure Chest are on every 4th floor. Once you open a treasure chest, you will find 10,000 points, 30,000 points, 50,000 points, and then a 1UP.
You can have more lives than the 4 shown.
I picked up a bell on Floor 1 and got bonus time.
Floor 15: For the wand, walk around all corners clockwise to the first corner.
Floor 20: For the wand, beat the same enemy twice.
Floor 28: For the wand, get no crystals and warp.
Wiz-Man Stage Select Code: At the title screen, Up Up A A B B.
It sounds like some players go for score and others go for speed. Maybe two leaderboards?
There are various sections, and a "coffee break" plays after finishing each section.
